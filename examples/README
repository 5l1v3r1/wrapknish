This example was created by running the following commands:

cd /tmp/wrapknish/examples/src
../../wrapknish -p net/http -n wrapped_ -c ../my_http_hooks
cd ..
GOPATH=/tmp/wrapknish/examples go build

my_http_hooks contains the code overrides to apply to the net/http package -- in this case, the http.client.Head() method and http.Post() function.

You can find the output of this command under wrapped_net/http.
